    <p>As a young boy I was enchanted by watching plants grow.
    When I was 10 years old I saved up my quarters until I had enough to buy tomato seeds that were advertised in my comic book.
    I remember how excited I was when they arrived in the mail. I rushed out to my backyard and planted them as quickly as I could. Every day for the next 2 months I nurtured the growing plants.
    10 scraggly plants sprouted and grew but only bore 4 tomatoes.
    Still I was hooked.
    To this day I marvel at how plants grow day by day.
    I started planning my current garden 23 years ago when my wife and I and our 3 children moved into our first and only house that we bought.
    I wanted to create my own personal botanical garden that would contain as many varieties of plants as possible with a shifting display from week to week.
    It has been a labor of love and has provided me with thousands of hours that nourish my soul.
    I am pleased to be able to share my garden with the world now through this site.</p>
